# Critical Deployment Status and Solution

## üö® Current Critical Issues

### 1. Git Merge Conflicts (CRITICAL)
- **Status**: Repository is in unresolved merge state
- **Affected Files**: next.config.ts, package.json, and multiple other files
- **Impact**: Blocks all Git operations and deployment
- **Next.js Server**: Crashing due to merge conflict markers in next.config.ts

### 2. PowerShell Tasks Issues
- **Status**: Git commit commands failing due to incorrect PowerShell syntax
- **Impact**: Cannot commit resolved changes

## üîß Immediate Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Complete Git Merge Resolution
```powershell
# Check current merge status
git status

# Resolve each unmerged file manually:
# For each file listed under "Unmerged paths", choose the correct version

# Add resolved files
git add .

# Complete the merge
git commit -m "Resolve all merge conflicts and complete merge"

# Push to remote
git push
```

### Step 2: Fix PowerShell Task Syntax
Update `.vscode/tasks.json` to use correct PowerShell syntax:
- Replace `& 'git commit'` with `git commit`
- Remove unnecessary quotes around git commands

### Step 3: Verify Application Status
- Test application locally after merge resolution
- Confirm all features working
- Run deployment verification

## üìä Current Application Status

### ‚úÖ Working Components
- **Authentication**: User registration/login functional
- **Database**: Supabase connection established
- **Exercises**: Exercise system with AI generation working
- **Progress Tracking**: Basic progress saving working
