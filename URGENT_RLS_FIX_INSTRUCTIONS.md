# üö® URGENT: Fix Infinite Recursion Error in Supabase

The Vercel deployment is failing with this error:
```
‚ùå Database save failed: {
  code: '42P17',
  details: null,
  hint: null,
  message: 'infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "users"'
}
```

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Go to SQL Editor**
3. **Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase/simple-rls.sql`**
4. **Execute the script**

This will:
- ‚úÖ Remove all conflicting RLS policies
- ‚úÖ Create clean, non-recursive policies
- ‚úÖ Fix the infinite recursion error
- ‚úÖ Enable proper admin access for exercise generation

## What This Fixes

The infinite recursion was caused by overlapping RLS policies that created circular dependency chains. The current policies were trying to check themselves, creating an endless loop.

## After Running the Fix

1. Your Vercel deployment should work correctly
2. Admin exercise generation will function properly
3. User access will remain secure
4. No more infinite recursion errors

**This is a critical fix that must be applied to Supabase immediately for the application to function properly.**
