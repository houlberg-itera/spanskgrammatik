# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Educational Requirements**:
   - Each CEFR level → content development task [P]
   - Each exercise type → generation service task [P]
   - Each learning objective → assessment task
   
2. **From Technical Contracts**:
   - Each API endpoint → contract test task [P]
   - Each component → rendering test [P]
   - Each service → integration test [P]
   
3. **From User Learning Journeys**:
   - Each learning path → user experience test [P]
   - Each progress milestone → tracking validation task
   - Each personalization scenario → AI effectiveness test

4. **Constitutional Compliance**:
   - All tasks must align with 5 core principles
   - Educational tasks must meet CEFR standards
   - AI tasks must demonstrate personalization value
   - Performance tasks must meet speed requirements
   - Component tasks must ensure reusability

5. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Educational Content → Services → Integration → Quality Assurance
   - Educational dependencies: Content → Generation → Assessment → Personalization
   - Technical dependencies: Auth → Data → Logic → UI → Performance
