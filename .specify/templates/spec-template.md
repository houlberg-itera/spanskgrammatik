# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Acceptance Criteria

*Constitutional Compliance Checks:*
- [ ] **Learner-Centered Design**: Feature prioritizes user experience and accessibility
- [ ] **Educational Excellence**: Content and interactions support effective learning outcomes
- [ ] **AI-Powered Personalization**: Incorporates adaptive elements where applicable
- [ ] **Component-Based Architecture**: Implementation uses reusable, maintainable components
- [ ] **Performance-First Engineering**: Meets speed and efficiency requirements

*Functional Verification:*
- [ ] **Given** [precondition], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
- [ ] **Given** [another scenario], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]  
- [ ] **Given** [edge case], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

*Technical Quality Gates:*
- [ ] Code passes TypeScript compilation without errors
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, e2e as applicable)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (< 3s page loads, < 500ms API responses)
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied (authentication, authorization, data protection)
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)

*Educational Quality Gates (if applicable):*
- [ ] Content accuracy validated by language learning experts
- [ ] CEFR level alignment verified
- [ ] User testing shows positive learning outcomes
- [ ] AI personalization effectiveness measured and validated

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Education-specific requirements (if applicable):*
- **FR-EDU-001**: Learning content MUST align with CEFR levels (A1, A2, B1)
- **FR-EDU-002**: Exercise generation MUST leverage AI for personalization
- **FR-EDU-003**: Progress tracking MUST adapt to individual learner performance

*Performance requirements (mandatory):*
- **FR-PERF-001**: Page load time MUST be < 3 seconds on 3G connections
- **FR-PERF-002**: API responses MUST be < 500ms (exercises) or < 2s (AI generation)

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]
